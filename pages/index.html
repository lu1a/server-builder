    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>
        Server builder is a cooperative that builds industrial-strength computers here in Finland.
        <br />
        We aren't for profit, we're for the community and the commons.
        <br />
        We build using both first and second hand components.
        <br />
        We sell pre-built, repurposed, and fully second-hand servers.
        <br />
        Please browse our product list to see more.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are a green organization that breathes life back into second-hand parts so that we can compute a little more sustainably.
        <br />
        Our goal for our first-hand products is to eventually build servers whose parts are only from within the country.
